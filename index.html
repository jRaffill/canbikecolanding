    <p> Thank you for participating in the data collection activity for our project titled “Location History Based Travel Pattern Prediction” </p>
    <b>Project Background:</b> 
    <p>Our research team is interested in exploring ways in which travel patterns of individuals can be collected, analyzed, and used for travel and traffic forecasts. To this end, we would like to collect a snapshot of your travel footprint, along with a few questions regarding your socio-demographic profile. Does this seem like a lot of work? Not to worry, providing your data is facilitated through an open source easy to use location history data collection application called emTripLog. The app installation and responding to the survey will not take more than 10 minutes of your time. The information you provide will help advance the state of practice in travel data collection, and travel pattern forecasting. Your data contribution will come back to you as improved travel management and traffic conditions in your city (lesser travel times, lesser congestion, you get the drift!). We would like to assure you that <b><i>your information will never be made public or sold and will only be used for the research proposed in this project. </i></b> </p>
    <b>There are just 3 steps to complete this survey: </b>
    <ol> <li>Install the emTripLog app on your phone </li>
      <li>Complete a 3-minute survey regarding your socio-demographics </li>
      <li>Use the app and provide travel data for 3 days </li> </ol>

    <b>Frequently Asked Questions </b> <br/>
    <p class="faq">The app doesn’t appear to be doing anything? </p>
    <p>The app works best when all notifications are on. In the location settings of your phone please select “Always Allow” for the emTripLog app. </p>
    <p class="faq">I get the following message when I open emTripLog: “Download new UI-only update to build …". What should I do?  </p>
    <p>Simply click “Apply” and you will download the content for our study. </p>
    <p class="faq">I have completed the phone survey and clicked “submit”. A popup appears, then, nothing seems to happen. </p>
    <p>Your submission has been recorded. Feel free to click the “x” mark in the upper-right corner of the survey. </p>
    <p class="faq">What kind of data will you be collecting? </p>
    <p>For this study, we are collecting trajectory data from mobile devices via GPS, along with the demographic survey. The user has the option to additionally provide information about their mode of travel for a given trip. </p>
